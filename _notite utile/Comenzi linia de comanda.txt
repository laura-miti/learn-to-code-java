VIM
This brings up a tool called Vim where we need to add our merge commit message, similar to a regular commit. Now we won't be going over Vim in detail, but 
we can add our message by typing I to enter the interactive mode and then writing our merge commit message, which in our case, we'll just leave it as it already is. 
And then when done, hitting the escape key, followed by :wq. 
The w saves our changes, a
nd the q quits Vim.
